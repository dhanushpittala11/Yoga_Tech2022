# About the Project
   Application of sensors in Healthcare has been rapidly increasing these days. Collection of data from sensors which can be placed on various parts of our body,         transmitting this data wirelessly to a device which we can carry along with us and then displaying the state of our body parameters has made our lives easier. We, the Biomedical Engineering department at IIT Hyderabad demonstrated how technology can be used in yoga. I had made a sensor based prototype which determines expansion and contraction of our chest and thorax. The data is collected and transmitted over the server. Having done that, It was used for analysis.
